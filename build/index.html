                  <p>
                    Socket Runtime is like a next-generation Electron. Build native apps for any OS
                    using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, for desktop &amp; mobile! You can also connect
                    your users, and let them communicate directly, without the cloud or any servers!
                  </p>

                  <h2>Features</h2>

                <markdown-module src="src/docs/guide-apple.md"><h1 id="apple-guide">Apple Guide</h1>
<p>The following is a guide for building apps on Apple's <code>MacOS</code> and <code>iOS</code>
operating systems.</p>
<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<ol>
<li>Sign up for a (free) <a href="https://developer.apple.com/">Apple Developer</a> account.</li>
<li>Register your <a href="https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/devices/add">devices</a> for testing. You can use <code>ssc list-devices</code>
command to get your Device ID (UDID). The device should be connected to your mac by wire.</li>
<li>Create a wildcard <a href="https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers">App ID</a> for the application you are developing.</li>
<li>Write down your <code>Team ID</code>. It's in the top right corner of the website. You'll need this later.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="macos">MacOS</h3>
<ul>
<li>Xcode Command Line Tools. If you don't have them already, and you don't have xcode,
you can run the command <code>xcode-select --install</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ios">iOS</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/resources/">Xcode</a> (You won't need to even open it)</li>
<li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-configurator/id1037126344">Apple Configurator</a> (If you want to build iOS apps)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="code-signing-certificates">Code Signing Certificates</h2>
<ul>
<li>Open Keychain Access application on your mac (it's in Applications/Utilities).</li>
<li>In the Keychain Access application choose Keychain Access -&gt; Certificate Assistant -&gt; Request a Certificate From a Certificate Authority...<img src="../images/screenshots/prov-prof-1.png" class="shadowed"></li>
<li>Type your email in the User Email Address field. Other form elements are optional.
<img src="../images/screenshots/prov-prof-2.png" alt=""></li>
<li>Choose Request is Saved to Disc and save your certificate request.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="macos-1">MacOS</h3>
<p>Signing software on <code>MacOS</code> is optional but it's the best practice. Not signing
software is like using <code>http</code> instead of <code>https</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/add">Create</a> a new <code>Developer ID Application</code> certificate
on the Apple Developers website.</li>
<li>Choose a certificate request you've created 2 steps earlier.</li>
<li>Download your certificate and double-click to add it to your Keychain.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ios-1">iOS</h3>
<p>To run software on iOS, it <strong>must</strong> be signed by Xcode using the certificate data
contained in a "Provisioning Profile". This is a file generated by Apple and it
links <code>app identity</code>, <code>certificates</code> (used for code signing), <code>app permissions</code>,
and physical <code>devices</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/add">Create</a> a new iOS Distribution (App Store and Ad Hoc) certificate on the Apple Developers website.</li>
<li>Choose a certificate request you've created 2 steps earlier.</li>
<li>Download your certificate and double click to add it to your Keychain.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you run <code>ssc build --target=ios .</code> on your project for the first time, you may see the
following because you don't have a provisioning profile:</p>
<pre><code>ssc build --target=ios .
• provisioning profile not found: <span class="hljs-regexp">/Users/</span>chicoxyzzy/dev/socketsupply/birp/./distribution.mobileprovision. Please specify a valid provisioning profile <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> the ios_provisioning_profile field <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> your <span class="hljs-string">`ssc.config`</span>
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/profiles/add">Create</a> a new Ad Hoc profile. Use the App ID you created with the wildcard.</li>
<li>Pick the certificate that you added to your Keychain two steps earlier.</li>
<li>Add the devices that the profile will use.</li>
<li>Add a name for your new distribution profile (we recommend naming it "distribution").</li>
<li>Download the profile and double-click it. This action will open Xcode. You can close it after it's completely loaded.</li>
<li>Place your profile in your project directory (same directory as <code>ssc.config</code>). <strong>The profiles are secret, add your profile to <code>.gitignore</code></strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>
<h3 id="macos-2">MacOS</h3>
<p>You will want to ensure the following fields are filled out in your <code>ssc.config</code>
file. They will look something like this...</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml"><span class="hljs-attr">mac_team_id:</span> <span class="hljs-string">Z3M838H537</span>
<span class="hljs-attr">mac_sign: Developer ID Application:</span> <span class="hljs-string">Operator</span> <span class="hljs-string">Tools</span> <span class="hljs-string">Inc.</span> <span class="hljs-string">(Z3M838H537)</span>
</code></pre>
<h3 id="ios-2">iOS</h3>
<ol>
<li>Set the <code>ios_distribution_method</code> value in <code>ssc.config</code> to the <code>ad-hoc</code></li>
<li>Set the <code>ios_codesign_identity</code> value in <code>ssc.config</code> to the <a href="#certificate">certificate</a> name as it's displayed in the Keychan or copy it from the output of <code>security find-identity -v -p codesigning</code></li>
<li>Set the <code>ios_provisioning_profile</code> value in <code>ssc.config</code> to the filename of your certificate (i.e., "distribution.mobileprovision").</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="development">Development</h2>
<p>Create a simulator VM and launch the app in it</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">ssc build --target=iossimulator -r .
</code></pre>
<h2 id="distribution-and-deployment">Distribution And Deployment</h2>
<pre><code class="language-bash">ssc build --target=ios -c -p -xd .
</code></pre>
<h3 id="to-your-device">To your device</h3>
<p>Install <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-configurator/id1037126344">Apple Configurator</a>, open it and install Automation Tools from the menu.</p>
<p>Connect your device and run <code>ssc install-app &lt;path&gt;</code> where path is the root directory of your application (the one where <code>ssc.config</code> is located).</p>
<p>An alternative way to install your app is to open the <code>Apple Configurator</code> app and drag
the inner <code>/dist/build/[your app name].ipa/[your app name].ipa</code> file onto your phone.</p>
<h3 id="to-the-apple-app-store">To the Apple App Store</h3>
<pre><code class="language-bash">xcrun altool --validate-app \
  -f file \
  -t platform \
  -u username [-p password] \
  [--output-format xml]
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-bash">xcrun altool --upload-app \
  -f file \
  -t platform \
  -u username [-p password] \
  [—output-format xml]
</code></pre>
<h2 id="debugging">Debugging</h2>
<p>Check the [troubleshooting guide][/troubleshooting] first. You can also run
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/gdb_to_lldb_transition_guide/document/lldb-terminal-workflow-tutorial.html"><code>lldb</code></a> and attach to a process, for example...</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">process attach --name TestExample-dev
</code></pre>
<h2 id="logging">Logging</h2>
<p>To see logs on either platform, open <code>Console.app</code> (installed on MacOS by default)
and in the right side panel pick the device or computer name.</p>
<h2 id="working-with-the-file-system-on-ios">Working with the file system on iOS</h2>
<p>iOS Application Sandboxing has a set of rules that limits access to the file system.
Apps can only access files in their own sandboxed home directory.</p>

<p>You'll want to write code, see it, change it, and repeat this cycle. So the
typical approach is to create a watch script that rebuilds your files when
there are changes. If you provide a port, the <code>ssc</code> command will try to load
<code>http://localhost</code>.</p>
<pre><code>ssc build -r --port=<span class="hljs-number">8000</span>
</code></pre>
<p>You'll need to tell your build script the output location. The <code>ssc</code> command
can tell you the platform specific build destination. For example.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why</h2>
<p>There are broadly 3 categories of concerns addressed by P2P.</p>
<h3 id="complexity">Complexity</h3>
<p>One server to many users is a natural bottle-neck, and scaling them up quickly
becomes a complex distribued system of shared state. A P2P network is many users
to many users, and although it is also an eventually consistent, distribued
system of shared state, the total complexity of all components needed to create
a P2P network are finite, transparent and can be formally verified.</p>
<h3 id="security--sovereignty">Security &amp; Sovereignty</h3>
<p>Cloud (even Gov. Cloud) are closed systems, owned by third parties. There is
always a non-zero chance for a greater number of incidents than if the network,
data, and software was entirely self-contained without a man-in-the-middle.</p>
<h3 id="cost">Cost</h3>
<p>Servers, and cloud infrastructure in general, become more expensive as demand
increases. Although "free tiers" can be cheap for trivial, they can be prohibitive
for many kinds of businesses.</p>
<h2 id="use-cases">Use Cases</h2>
<p>The protocol is limited to connecting peers and delivering datagrams with a high
degree of reliably. It sits directly on top of UDP and is suitable for building
applications and protocols. Uses case examples include chat, social networks, mail,

<h3 id="nat-traversal">NAT Traversal</h3>
<h4 id="problem-description">Problem Description</h4>
<p>With client-server architecture, any client can directly request a response from
a server. However in peer-to-peer architecture, any client can not request a
response from any other client.</p>
<p>P2P software needs to listen for new messages from unknown people. However most
routers will discard unsolicited packets. It is possible to work around this
problem.</p>
<p>P2P connectivity requires coordination between three or more peers. Consider the
following analogy.</p>
<p>Alice wants to write a letter to Bob. But Bob moves frequently, and she has no
other way to contact him. Before Alice can send Bob the letter, she needs to
learn his address. The solution is for her to ask some friends who might have
talked to Bob recently.</p>
<p>In this anology, Alice's letter is really a packet of data. Bob's address is his
external <code>IP address</code> and <code>port</code>. And their friends, are a serializable list of
recently known IP addresses and ports. You can read more about the technical
details in the <code>STATE_0</code> section of the <a href="https://github.com/socketsupply/stream-relay/spec/README.md">spec</a>.</p>
<h3 id="small-networks">Small Networks</h3>
<h4 id="problem-description-1">Problem Description</h4>
<p>Imagine a scenario where Alice and Bob are sending each other messages. Alice
goes offline. Bob continues to write messages to Alice. And because the App Bob
is using has a good "local first" user experience, it appears to Bob as if
everything is fine and that Alice should eventually receive all his messages,
so he also goes offline. When Alice comes online, she doesn’t see Bob’s most
recent messages because he’s not online to share them.</p>
<h4 id="problem-summary--solution-deficits">Problem Summary &amp; Solution Deficits</h4>
<p>This is a very common problem with P2P, it’s sometimes called the Small Network
Problem. How well data can survive in a network with this problem is referred to
as "partition tolerance". This problem is often solved by using
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5766">STUN and TURN</a> (relay servers), but these add additional infrastructure that
comes at a cost (both in terms of time, money, and expertise).</p>
<h4 id="solution">Solution</h4>
<p>The way Stream Relay Protocol solves this problem is with a shared, global
packet caching strategy. Every peer in the entire network allocates a small
budget (16Mb by default) for caching packets from any other peer in the network.</p>
<p>A peer will cache random packets with a preference for packets that have a topic
ID that the peer subscribes to. A packet starts out with a postage value of 16
(A peer will never accept a packet with a postage value greater than 16). When a
packet nears its max-age, it is re-broadcast to 3 more random peers in the
network, each taxing its postage by a value of 1 when received, unless its
postage value is 0, in which case it is no longer re-broadcast and is purged
from the peer’s cache.</p>
<p>When a message is published, it is also re-broadcast by at least 3 random peers,
with a preference for the intended recipient and peers that subscribe to the
same topic. The result of this is a high <code>r-value</code> (or <code>r0</code>, also known as Basic
Reproduction Ratio in epidemiology).</p>
<h4 id="solution-summary--solution-gains">Solution Summary &amp; Solution Gains</h4>
<p>In <a href="/test/cases/ratio.js">simulations</a>, a network of <code>128 peers</code>, where the join and drop rate are
<code>&gt;95%</code>, <code>+/-30%</code> of NATs are hard, and only <code>+/-50%</code> of the peers subscribe to
the topic ID; an unsolicited packet can replicate to <code>100%</code> of the subscribers
in an average of <code>2.5 seconds</code>, degrading to only <code>50%</code> after a 1000% churn
(unrealistically hostile network conditions) over a <code>&gt;1 minute</code> period.</p>
<p>This strategy also improves as the number of participants in the network
increases, since the size of the cache and time packets need to live in it is
reduced. If we revisit our original problem with this strategy, we can
demonstrate a high degree of partition tolerance. It can be said that the peers
in a network act as relays (hence the name of the protocol).</p>
<p>Bob continues to write (optionally encrypted) messages to Alice after she goes
offline, and his packets are published to the network. A network of only 1024
peers (split across multiple apps), will provide Bob’s packets a 100% survival
rate over a 24 hour period, without burdening any particular peer with storage
or compute requirements. Allowing Alice to return to the network and see Bob’s
most recent messages without the need for additional infrastructure.</p>
<h3 id="cache-negotiation">Cache Negotiation</h3>
<p>TODO</p>
<h3 id="connectionless">Connectionless</h3>
<p>TCP is oftern thought of as an ideal choice for packet delivery since it's
considered "reliable". With TCP packet loss, all packets are withheld until all
packets are received, this can be a delay of up to 1s (as per RFC6298 section
2.4). If the packet can't be retransmitted, an exponential backoff could lead to
another 600ms of delay needed for retransmission.</p>
<p>In fact, <code>Head-of-Line Blocking</code> is generally a problem with any ordered stream,
TCP (or UDP with additional higher level protocol code for solving this problem).</p>
<p>TCP introduces other unwanted complexity that makes it less ideal for P2P.</p>
<p>UDP is only considered "unreliable" in the way that packets are not guaranteed
to be delivered. However, UDP is ideal for P2P networks because it’s message
oriented and connectionless (ideal for NAT traversal). Also because of its
message oriented nature, it’s light weight in terms of resource allocation. It's
the responsibility of a higher level protocol to implement a strategy for
ensuring UDP packets are delivered.</p>
<p>Stream Relay Protocol eliminates Head-of-Line blocking entirely by reframing
packets as content-addressable Doubly-Linked lists, allowing packets to be
delivered out of order and become eventually consistent. Causal ordering is made
possible by traversing the previous ID or next ID to determine if there were
packets that came before or after one that is known.</p>
<p>And in the case where there is loss (or simply missing data), the receiver MAY
decide to request the packet. If the peer becomes unavailable, query the network
for the missing packet.</p>
<p>The trade-off is more data is required to re-frame the packet. The average
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_transmission_unit">MTU</a> for a UDP packet is ~1500 bytes. Stream Relay Protocol uses ~134 bytes
for framing, allocating <code>1024</code> bytes of application or protocol data, which is
<a href="https://gafferongames.com/post/snapshot_compression/">more than enough</a>.</p>

<p>Socket Supply Co. builds and maintains a free and open source Runtime that helps web developers build apps for any OS, desktop and mobile. You can use plain old HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as your favorite front-end libraries for example React, Svelte, and Vue.</p>
<p>A core feature of Socket Runtime is its p2p capabilities. Our runtime exposes primitives needed for building peer-to-peer and local-first applications, such as Bluetooth, UDP, and robust file system access. Our p2p component allows developers to create apps where users can communicate directly, without the Cloud, it doesn’t require any servers at all, and even works when people are offline.</p>
<p>There is a complementary application performance management product (APM), Network Operator, that can diagnose and remediate issues within the production apps you build.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-i-trust-what-socket-is-doing-with-my-applications">How can I trust what Socket is doing with my applications?</h3>
<p>Socket is open-source. We would love for you to read all our code and see how we're doing things!</p>
<p>Feel free to contact us as well and we can walk you through it. </p>
<h3 id="but-youre-also-a-business-so-you-have-to-have-some-private-technologies-that-you-charge-for-to-make-money">But you're also a business, so you have to have some private technologies that you charge for, to make money?</h3>
<p>As stated above, Socket Supply Co. builds and maintains a free and open source Runtime that helps web developers build apps for any OS, desktop and mobile, as well as a p2p library, that enables developers to create apps where users can communicate directly, without the Cloud. </p>
<p>These will always be open-source and free to use by any developer, no matter what they use it for (commercial or personal). That will always be true.</p>
<p>Our Operator App has different tools which help in the entire lifecycle of building, deploying, and monitoring the Socket apps you build. Operator App has various pricing tiers which hackers, startups and enterprises can benefit from. (link to pricing grid)</p>
<p>No Socket powered app is ever required to use any of these paid services. Additionally, Socket will <em><strong>never charge</strong></em> for any of its tools or services on a <em>consumption</em> basis -- meaning that you pay us more depending on how many users/customers you have, or how much data is transmitted. </p>
<h3 id="how-is-socket-different-from-other-hybrid-native-app-tooling-such-as-electron-tauri-nativescript-react-native-ionic-etc">How is Socket different from other hybrid-native app tooling, such as Electron, Tauri, NativeScript, React Native, Ionic, etc?</h3>
<p>Socket is the first and only runtime to be cross-platform across desktop and mobile. Write once, run anywhere (iOS, Android, Linux, Windows, MacOS, and more!). It’s built from scratch, 1000 lines of code, 1.5MB binary size and has a significantly small memory footprint compared to others. However, the most important core differentiation are JavaScript APIs that provide Bluetooth, UDP, and robust file system access. These make it possible to create an entirely need class of P2P and local-first apps. Apps where users can communicate directly, without the Cloud. Every other runtime is a means to an end, ours is intended to subvert Cloud infrastructure entirely ;)</p>
<h3 id="we-already-have-teams-of-engineers-that-build-our-web-and-other-native-platform-app-experiences-why-would-we-benefit-from-socket">We already have teams of engineers that build our web and other native-platform app experiences. Why would we benefit from Socket?</h3>
<p>Customers can prioritize what they want to solve when working with Socket. There are many benefits to choose from for a wide variety of reasons. </p>
<p>Autonomy - Right now you’re entirely codependent on a 3rd party to run a mission critical part of your business. The Cloud is a landlord-tenant relationship with costs that can prevent your business from becoming profitable. Socket helps you connect your users directly to each other, allowing you to rely less on the Cloud, reclaim your sovereignty, and your profit margins.</p>
<p>Reducing complexity is an important metric for many engineering teams. Companies whose applications are built across desktop and mobile would be moving from working and maintaining &gt;=3 code bases in their current state to 1 code base with Socket. This drastically reduces complexity within the organization and speeds up innovation. </p>
<p>Decentralization is an important metric that can be solved by running p2p, Socket customers can claim they are truly decentralized. </p>
<p>Building multiplayer capabilities in products is a benefit Productivity / Collaboration tools would find as a major benefit to building on Socket. Evan Wallace, Co-founder and good friend from Figma said it best “these days it’s obvious that multiplayer is the way all productivity tools on the web should work, not just design.”(link for appendix). Costs.</p>
<p>Cost reduction is a clear benefit from building on Socket. For smaller teams who don’t have native teams in place, they can get to their customers quicker by writing once, running anywhere. Cloud bills are the #1 cost for many organizations, building on Socket reduces that to $0, or as much as you want to migrate off the cloud. We say crawl, walk, run. </p>
<h3 id="is-this-somehow-related-to-web3">Is this somehow related to Web3?</h3>
<p>If we define “web 3” to mean a decentralized web, then yes. We don’t really take a position on anything else.</p>
<p>We provide a technical foundation that makes it possible for many Web3 ideals to come to fruition.</p>
<p>In its current state Web3 is not decentralized. The ecosystem relies heavily on centralized cloud providers like AWS for infrastructure. This is an economic disadvantage and in most cases a barrier to entry. However, apps built with Socket’s P2P capabilities can be 100% decentralized, absolutely no servers are required. They can be fully autonomous, aligning directly with the mission of the web3 community. </p>
<h3 id="doesnt-p2p-without-centralized-servers-mean-that-only-users-that-are-online-at-the-same-time-can-share-and-communicate-with-each-other">Doesn't P2P (without centralized servers) mean that only users that are online at the same time can share and communicate with each other?</h3>
<p>No! Socket drives a UDP multicast protocol that sends information from one user's device to a variety of other "peer" devices -- those with knowledge of each other at a networking level (IP address, port) -- and those peers will in turn <strong>relay</strong> this information onward to other peers.</p>
<p>A message sent from one device will thus <em>bounce around</em> the peer matrix of devices until it is able to reach the intended recipient, even if the sender and recipient are never online at the same time.</p>
<h3 id="wait-a-minute-youre-saying-that-if-i-send-information-to-my-friend-or-coworker-any-other-connected-peer-devices-will-see-this-message-as-they-relay-it-on">Wait a minute, you're saying that if I send information to my friend or coworker, any other connected peer devices will see this message as they relay it on?</h3>
<p>Yes and no. Peers <em>do</em> all relay packets for each other, to ensure that any peer <em>can</em> communicate with any other peer, even if they aren't directly connected or ever online with each other at the same time.</p>
<p>However, all data packets (those used for user data, not network coordination) are encrypted, such that only the intended recipient of the packets can decrypt and access the information therein.</p>
<p>So your message will reside in parts (packet by packet) on many other users' devices, at various times, but only in parts and only encrypted, meaning those other devices cannot make any sense of that data.</p>
<p>This encryption/decryption security uses industry-standard -- and audited! -- public key cryptography, similar to --- and at least as safe as! -- the HTTPS/TLS encryption that users across the web trust for communication with very sensitive sources, including banks, doctors, etc.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-i-know-that-a-message-i-receive-and-decrypt-was-not-tampered-with-or-faked-by-someone-other-than-who-the-message-claims-to-be-from">How do I know that a message I receive (and decrypt) was not tampered with or faked by someone other than who the message claims to be from?</h3>
<p>At the network packet level, packets are encrypted using the public key of the intended recipient. Only the recipient (holding the paired private key) could possibly decrypt the packet, which would be necessary for tampering.</p>
<p>Any man-in-the-middle tampering with an encrypted packet would render the final decrypted value as garbage. The app would be able to immediately tell that the expected data was garbled and thus discard it.</p>
<p>Corrupted (or manipulated) packets, or even dropped/missing packets, can be automatically <em>re-queried</em> across the peer network, to reacquire the necessary packets. As such, the encryption used guarantees that information received is either complete and in-tact, before decryption, or entirely dropped.</p>
<p>As for determining the identity authenticity of the sender, the network protocol does not employ overhead of digital signatures or verification, nor digital certificates.</p>
<p>Socket powered apps are allowed, and expected, to employ their own security layered on top of (tunneled through) the network encryption provided automatically. This may included additional encryption, digital signatures, digital certificates (identity verification), and more, according to the needs and capabilities of the app.</p>
<p>All of those app-specific techniques are still able to be leveraged and negotiated across the Socket-powered peer network.</p>
<h3 id="i-am-nervous-about-other-people-transmitting-arbitrary-information-that-may-be-on-my-device-because-this-information-could-open-me-up-to-liability-legal-etc-how-am-i-protected-if-i-allow-my-device-to-relay-information-for-others-i-dont-know-or-trust">I am nervous about other people transmitting arbitrary information that may be on my device, because this information could open me up to liability (legal, etc). How am I protected if I allow my device to relay information for others I don't know or trust?</h3>
<p>Your device never holds plain-text (or plainly accessible) data on behalf of any other user. The packets your device relays on behalf of others was encrypted for those intended recipients, and your device could never possibly decrypt or make sense of any of that data.</p>
<p>You thus have perfect deniability as your protection from those potential risks/liabilities.</p>
<p>This is analogous to internet infrastructure like switches/routers, which are peppered by the billions around the web. None of these devices can decrypt the HTTPS traffic transiting through them, and thus none of those devices ever have any liability for the kinds of information buried inside the encrypted data as it flows through.</p>
<p>Socket isn't introducing anything more dangerous here than has already existed for the last 25+ years of the internet.</p>
<p>More importantly, the relay of packets through your device only happens <em>in memory</em> (never on disk), and only while you have a Socket powered app open for use. If you close the app, or power-off / restart your device, that cache is wiped completely; the in-memory cache only gets filled back up with more packets when you open a Socket powered app while online.</p>
<p>As the device user, it's always your choice and in your control.</p>
<h3 id="does-this-mean-that-other-people-can-use-my-device-for-performing-heavy-computations-bitcoin-mining-etc-without-my-consent">Does this mean that other people can use my device for performing heavy computations (bitcoin mining, etc) without my consent?</h3>
<p>No!</p>
<p>The P2P relaying of packets is merely a pass-thru of (encrypted) data. Your device performs almost no computation on these packets, other than to check the plaintext headers to figure out whether and how to relay it along.</p>
<p>Aside from this very simple and fast processing of these packets, your device will never perform any computation on behalf of any other person.</p>
<p>The <em>only</em> exception would be computation you had directly and expressly consented to via an app that you chose to install and open/use, <em>if</em> that app was designed in such a way to share computation work with others.</p>
<p>For example, "SETI@home" type apps intentionally distribute computation (image processing, etc) among a vast array of devices that have idle/unused computing power being <em>donated</em> to a good cause. Another plausible example: some apps are currently exploring distributing machine-learning (ML/AI) computations among an array of peers.</p>
<p>If you installed such an app, and opened it, your device would subject itself to app-level computation on behalf of others. But you remain in control of all those decisions, including closing such apps, uninstalling them, etc. And if you didn't install and open such an app, none of that distributed computation would ever happen on your device, regardless of how others use the P2P network.</p>
<p><strong>No unintended/background/abusive computation on your device is ever be possible</strong> by virtue of the Socket P2P protocol itself. Only apps themselves can coordinate such distributed computation activities, and only with expressed installation consent from users.</p>
<h3 id="aside-from-cpu-computation-doesnt-allowing-my-device-to-participate-in-packet-relay-for-many-other-peers-subject-my-device-to-extra-resource-utilization-using-up-my-memory-draining-my-battery-more-quickly-etc">Aside from CPU computation, doesn't allowing my device to participate in packet relay for many other peers subject my device to extra resource utilization (using up my memory, draining my battery more quickly, etc)?</h3>
<p>The only resource utilization that occurs is that which you consent to by opening and using Socket powered apps.</p>
<p>Socket limits the memory used for the packet relay cache, currently to 16MB (not GB!). This is an extremely small slice of typical device memory, even budget-level smart phones (which typically have at least 1-2 GB of memory).</p>
<p>As for battery, Socket does not perform unnecessary background work, so any battery usage you experience should be directly proportional to the active use of a Socket powered app.</p>
<p>Relaying packets is a very simple and resource-light type of task. In our testing, we haven't seen any noticeable increase in resource load on devices as a result of running a Socket powered app, compared to any other consumer apps users typically use.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, Socket powered apps tend to use and transmit way less data than other commercial/consumer apps, so users can expect in general to see no worse -- and often much improved! -- resource utilization than for non-Socket powered apps.</p>
<h3 id="does-p2p-packet-relay-mean-that-data-transmission-such-as-me-sending-a-text-message-or-picture-to-a-friend-will-go-much-slower">Does P2P packet relay mean that data transmission, such as me sending a text message or picture to a friend, will go much slower?</h3>
<p>P2P packet relay, even across a broad network of many millions of devices, is surprisingly fast and efficient, compared to typical presumptions.</p>
<p>If the sender and receiver of a message are both online at time of a message being sent, and are at most a few hops away in terms of the packet relay protocol of Socket, this transmission should take no more than a couple of seconds, but probably orders of magnitude faster.</p>
<p>In fact, since this communication is much more direct than in typical infrastructure, where messages have to go all the way out to a cloud server, and then on to the recipient, it's quite likely that communications will be at least as fast, if not much faster, via P2P communications techniques (relay, etc) as described.</p>
<h3 id="if-the-recipient-of-my-message-is-not-online-when-i-send-it-how-long-will-the-packets-stay-alive-in-the-p2p-network-before-being-dropped-if-the-recipient-has-not-yet-come-online-and-received-the-packets">If the recipient of my message is not online when I send it, how long will the packets <em>stay alive</em> in the P2P network before being dropped, if the recipient has not yet come online and received the packets?</h3>
<p>There's a lot of <em>it depends</em> in this answer (including size of the message -- how many packets -- and network activity/congestion).</p>
<p>But in general, messages may be able to survive for as long as a couple of weeks, and almost never less than several days.</p>
<p>Apps are expected to design with the nature of lack of delivery guarantees in P2P networks in focus. To help users compensate and adapt, these apps should provide appropriate user experience affordances, including "resend", "read receipt", and other such capabilities.</p>
<h3 id="ive-heard-that-p2p-often-suffers-from-nat-traversal-complications-hard-nat-etc-so-how-reliably-will-peers-using-socket-powered-apps-be-able-to-connect-to-other-peers-depending-on-what-network-infrastructure-theyre-connected-to-at-the-time">I've heard that P2P often suffers from NAT traversal complications (hard NAT, etc), so how reliably will peers using Socket powered apps be able to connect to other peers, depending on what network infrastructure they're connected to at the time?</h3>
<p>Socket's P2P protocol includes a collection of sophisticated and robust techniques for peer introduction, NAT type discovery, and communication negotiation.</p>
<p>NAT traversal and negotiation is automatically handled, so that app developers do not need to worry about these messy details. That said, all our code is open-source, so we invite you to take a deeper look if you're curious how we handle these complicated tasks on your app's behalf.</p>
<h3 id="bad-actors-are-certainly-going-to-try-to-flood-the-network-with-junk-to-denydegrade-service-dos-attacks-attack-peers-ddos-attacks-etc-how-can-this-p2p-network-possibly-survive-such-abuse">Bad actors are certainly going to try to flood the network with junk, to deny/degrade service (DoS attacks), attack peers (DDoS attacks), etc. How can this P2P network possibly survive such abuse?</h3>
<p>The P2P packet relay protocol includes a sophisticated set of <em>balancing</em> techniques, which acts to ensure that no peer on the network places an outsized burden on other peers in the network.</p>
<p>Fluctuations and usage differences of course are a reality, but the protocol naturally resists the kinds of behaviors that bad actors rely on.</p>
<p>We've done a significant amount of modeling simulations and real-world field tests, and we're convinced that these types of attacks will ultimately prove impractical and not affect the ultimate trajectory and growth of our P2P network.</p>
<h3 id="is-this-like-bittorrent-tor-napster-gnutella-etc">Is this like BitTorrent, Tor, Napster, Gnutella etc?</h3>
<p>The web's roots are P2P, and yes there have been a number of widely known (and sometimes infamous!) attempts to bring the web back to its P2P identity over the years; some good, some not so good. Most of these are focused on file sharing. We see a broader opportunity with P2P which is focused on connecitivity, reduced infrastructure cost and reduced complexity in general.</p>
<p>We think the time has come for the web to return to the P2P model by default, to dismantle the wasteful and unnecessarily complicated (and expensive!) centralization trend that has given rise to the age of the "cloud". There are more than enough consumer devices, many of them highly connected, to accomplish a de-centralization.</p>
<p>While these changes have profound effects on improving how developers and businesses build and deliver experiences to consumers, it's the revolution of a user-centric web that most excites us, frankly.</p>
<p>Users don't need all of their data sent up to the cloud, nor do they want that. Users want privacy by default. Users don't need or want to be tracked with every single click or keystroke. Users don't want to <em>wait</em>, staring at spinners, while entire applications full of tens of megabytes of images, fonts, and JS code re-download every single page load. Users don't want or need walled-garden app stores to single-handedly decide what apps they're allowed to access, or how they're allowed to communicate and collaborate using those apps. Users don't want experiences that only work if they have a perfect internet connection, and die or are unavailable when wifi gets spotty.</p>
<p>All of these are hallmarks of the web as it is today, and all of these are tricks designed to work in favor of big centralized companies that slurp up all our data and then charge us rent to hold it. All of these are user-hostile behaviors that for the most part users can't opt out of, but overwhelmingly don't actually want.</p>
<p>Socket is a foundational building block that we believe can help usher in a new age of the web, one that puts users first. One that blurs the lines between websites and apps, and puts all those amazing experiences right on user's devices for them to use instantly, no matter where they are or what kind of internet connection they have (or not!). One that defaults to a local-first (or even local-only!) model that <em><strong>protects users' information by default</strong></em>.</p>
<p>We don't think putting developers in control, and moreover putting users in control, is a hype or a fad. We think it's exactly where the web has to go to survive, and we believe it's where everyone that builds for the web will shift to eventually. Those are admittedly pretty big aspirations and goals, but they're far from unrealistic or naive.</p>
