                  <p>
                    Socket Runtime is like a next-generation Electron. Build native apps for any OS
                    using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, for desktop &amp; mobile! You can also connect
                    your users, and let them communicate directly, without the cloud or any servers!
                  </p>

                  <h2>Features</h2>

<h3 id="from-create-socket-app">From Create Socket App</h3>
<p>Installing <code>Socket Runtime</code> from <a href="https://github.com/socketsupply/create-socket-app">Create Socket App</a>
will be instantly familiar to anyone who has used React's <code>Create React App</code>. To
use Create Socket App you’ll need to have <strong>Node 16.0.0</strong> or later version installed
on your computer.</p>
<p>The idea is to provide a few basic boilerplates and some strong opinions so
you can get coding on a production-quality app as quickly as possible. Create an
empty directory and try one of the following commands...</p>

<p>The following is a guide for building apps on Apple's <code>MacOS</code> and <code>iOS</code>
operating systems.</p>
<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<ol>
<li>Sign up for a (free) <a href="https://developer.apple.com/">Apple Developer</a> account.</li>
<li>Register your <a href="https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/devices/add">devices</a> for testing. You can use <code>ssc list-devices</code>
command to get your Device ID (UDID). The device should be connected to your mac by wire.</li>
<li>Create a wildcard <a href="https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers">App ID</a> for the application you are developing.</li>
<li>Write down your <code>Team ID</code>. It's in the top right corner of the website. You'll need this later.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="macos">MacOS</h3>
<ul>
<li>Xcode Command Line Tools. If you don't have them already, and you don't have Xcode,
you can run the command <code>xcode-select --install</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ios">iOS</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/resources/">Xcode</a> (You won't need to even open it)</li>
<li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-configurator/id1037126344">Apple Configurator</a> (If you want to build iOS apps)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="code-signing-certificates">Code Signing Certificates</h2>
<ul>
<li>Open the Keychain Access application on your mac (it's in Applications/Utilities).</li>
<li>In the Keychain Access application choose Keychain Access -&gt; Certificate Assistant -&gt; Request a Certificate From a Certificate Authority...<img src="../images/screenshots/prov-prof-1.png" class="shadowed"></li>
<li>Type your email in the User Email Address field. Other form elements are optional.
<img src="../images/screenshots/prov-prof-2.png" alt=""></li>
<li>Choose Request is Saved to Disc and save your certificate request.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="macos-1">MacOS</h3>
<p>Signing software on <code>MacOS</code> is optional but it's the best practice. Not signing
software is like using <code>http</code> instead of <code>https</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/add">Create</a> a new <code>Developer ID Application</code> certificate
on the Apple Developers website.</li>
<li>Choose a certificate request you created 2 steps earlier.</li>
<li>Download your certificate and double-click to add it to your Keychain.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ios-1">iOS</h3>
<p>To run software on iOS, it <strong>must</strong> be signed by Xcode using the certificate data
contained in a "Provisioning Profile". This is a file generated by Apple and it
links <code>app identity</code>, <code>certificates</code> (used for code signing), <code>app permissions</code>,
and physical <code>devices</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/add">Create</a> a new iOS Distribution (App Store and Ad Hoc) certificate on the Apple Developers website.</li>
<li>Choose a certificate request you created 2 steps earlier.</li>
<li>Download your certificate and double-click to add it to your Keychain.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you run <code>ssc build --target=ios .</code> on your project for the first time, you may see the
following because you don't have a provisioning profile:</p>
<pre><code>ssc build --target=ios .
• provisioning profile not found: <span class="hljs-regexp">/Users/</span>chicoxyzzy/dev/socketsupply/birp/./distribution.mobileprovision. Please specify a valid provisioning profile <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> the ios_provisioning_profile field <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> your <span class="hljs-string">`ssc.config`</span>
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/profiles/add">Create</a> a new Ad Hoc profile. Use the App ID you created with the wildcard.</li>
<li>Pick the certificate that you added to your Keychain two steps earlier.</li>
<li>Add the devices that the profile will use.</li>
<li>Add a name for your new distribution profile (we recommend naming it "distribution").</li>
<li>Download the profile and double-click it. This action will open Xcode. You can close it after it's completely loaded.</li>
<li>Place your profile in your project directory (same directory as <code>ssc.config</code>). <strong>The profiles are secret, add your profile to <code>.gitignore</code></strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>
<h3 id="macos-2">MacOS</h3>
<p>You will want to ensure the following fields are filled out in your <code>ssc.config</code>
file. They will look something like this...</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml"><span class="hljs-attr">mac_team_id:</span> <span class="hljs-string">Z3M838H537</span>
<span class="hljs-attr">mac_sign: Developer ID Application:</span> <span class="hljs-string">Operator</span> <span class="hljs-string">Tools</span> <span class="hljs-string">Inc.</span> <span class="hljs-string">(Z3M838H537)</span>
</code></pre>
<h3 id="ios-2">iOS</h3>
<ol>
<li>Set the <code>ios_distribution_method</code> value in <code>ssc.config</code> to the <code>ad-hoc</code></li>
<li>Set the <code>ios_codesign_identity</code> value in <code>ssc.config</code> to the <a href="#certificate">certificate</a> name as it's displayed in the Keychain or copy it from the output of <code>security find-identity -v -p codesigning</code></li>
<li>Set the <code>ios_provisioning_profile</code> value in <code>ssc.config</code> to the filename of your certificate (i.e., "distribution.mobileprovision").</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="development">Development</h2>
<p>Create a simulator VM and launch the app in it</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">ssc build --target=iossimulator -r .
</code></pre>
<h2 id="distribution-and-deployment">Distribution And Deployment</h2>
<pre><code class="language-bash">ssc build --target=ios -c -p -xd .
</code></pre>
<h3 id="to-your-device">To your device</h3>
<p>Install <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-configurator/id1037126344">Apple Configurator</a>, open it, and install Automation Tools from the menu.</p>
<p>Connect your device and run <code>ssc install-app &lt;path&gt;</code> where the path is the root directory of your application (the one where <code>ssc.config</code> is located).</p>
<p>An alternative way to install your app is to open the <code>Apple Configurator</code> app and drag
the inner <code>/dist/build/[your app name].ipa/[your app name].ipa</code> file onto your phone.</p>
<h3 id="to-the-apple-app-store">To the Apple App Store</h3>
<pre><code class="language-bash">xcrun altool --validate-app \

<p>You'll want to write code, see it, change it, and repeat this cycle. So the
typical approach is to create a watch script that rebuilds your files when
there are changes. If you provide a port, the <code>ssc</code> command will try to load

<pre><code>ssc build -r --port=<span class="hljs-number">8000</span>

<p>You'll need to tell your build script the output location. The <code>ssc</code> command

<h2 id="why">Why</h2>
<p>There are broadly 3 categories of concerns addressed by P2P.</p>
<h3 id="complexity">Complexity</h3>
<p>One server to many users is a natural bottle-neck, and scaling them up quickly
becomes a complex distributed system of shared state. A P2P network is many users
to many users, and although it is also an eventually consistent, distributed
system of shared state, the total complexity of all components needed to create
a P2P network is finite, transparent, and can be formally verified.</p>
<h3 id="security--sovereignty">Security &amp; Sovereignty</h3>
<p>Cloud (even Gov. Cloud) are closed systems, owned by third parties. There is
always a non-zero chance for a greater number of incidents than if the network,
data, and software was entirely self-contained without a man-in-the-middle.</p>
<h3 id="cost">Cost</h3>
<p>Servers, and cloud infrastructure in general, become more expensive as demand
increases. Although "free tiers" can be cheap or trivial, they can be prohibitive
for many kinds of businesses.</p>
<h2 id="use-cases">Use Cases</h2>
<p>The protocol is limited to connecting peers and delivering datagrams with a high
degree of reliability. It sits directly on top of UDP and is suitable for building
applications and protocols. Uses case examples include chat, social networks, mail,
photo and file sharing, distributed computing.</p>

<h3 id="nat-traversal">NAT Traversal</h3>
<h4 id="problem-description">Problem Description</h4>
<p>With client-server architecture, any client can directly request a response from
a server. However, in peer-to-peer architecture, any client can not request a
response from any other client.</p>
<p>P2P software needs to listen to new messages from unknown people. However, most
routers will discard unsolicited packets. It is possible to work around this
problem.</p>
<p>P2P connectivity requires coordination between three or more peers. Consider the
following analogy.</p>
<p>Alice wants to write a letter to Bob. But Bob moves frequently, and she has no
other way to contact him. Before Alice can send Bob the letter, she needs to
learn his address. The solution is for her to ask some friends who might have
talked to Bob recently.</p>
<p>In this analogy, Alice's letter is really a packet of data. Bob's address is his
external <code>IP address</code> and <code>port</code>. And their friends, are a serializable list of
recently known IP addresses and ports. You can read more about the technical
details in the <code>STATE_0</code> section of the <a href="https://github.com/socketsupply/stream-relay/spec/README.md">spec</a>.</p>
<h3 id="small-networks">Small Networks</h3>
<h4 id="problem-description-1">Problem Description</h4>
<p>Imagine a scenario where Alice and Bob are sending each other messages. Alice
goes offline. Bob continues to write messages to Alice. And because the App Bob
is using has a good "local first" user experience, it appears to Bob as if
everything is fine and that Alice should eventually receive all his messages,
so he also goes offline. When Alice comes online, she doesn’t see Bob’s most
recent messages because he’s not online to share them.</p>
<h4 id="problem-summary--solution-deficits">Problem Summary &amp; Solution Deficits</h4>
<p>This is a very common problem with P2P, it’s sometimes called the Small Network
Problem. How well data can survive in a network with this problem is referred to
as "partition tolerance". This problem is often solved by using
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5766">STUN and TURN</a> (relay servers), but these add additional infrastructure that
comes at a cost (both in terms of time, money, and expertise).</p>
<h4 id="solution">Solution</h4>
<p>The way Stream Relay Protocol solves this problem is with a shared, global
packet caching strategy. Every peer in the entire network allocates a small
budget (16Mb by default) for caching packets from any other peer in the network.</p>
<p>A peer will cache random packets with a preference for packets that have a topic
ID that the peer subscribes to. A packet starts out with a postage value of 16
(A peer will never accept a packet with a postage value greater than 16). When a
packet nears its max-age, it is re-broadcast to 3 more random peers in the
network, each taxing its postage by a value of 1 when received, unless its
postage value is 0, in which case it is no longer re-broadcast and is purged
from the peer’s cache.</p>
<p>When a message is published, it is also re-broadcast by at least 3 random peers,
with a preference for the intended recipient and peers that subscribe to the
same topic. The result of this is a high <code>r-value</code> (or <code>r0</code>, also known as Basic
Reproduction Ratio in epidemiology).</p>
<h4 id="solution-summary--solution-gains">Solution Summary &amp; Solution Gains</h4>
<p>In <a href="/test/cases/ratio.js">simulations</a>, a network of <code>128 peers</code>, where the join and drop rate are
<code>&gt;95%</code>, <code>+/-30%</code> of NATs are hard, and only <code>+/-50%</code> of the peers subscribe to
the topic ID; an unsolicited packet can replicate to <code>100%</code> of the subscribers
in an average of <code>2.5 seconds</code>, degrading to only <code>50%</code> after a 1000% churn
(unrealistically hostile network conditions) over a <code>&gt;1 minute</code> period.</p>
<p>This strategy also improves as the number of participants in the network
increases, since the size of the cache and time packets need to live in it is
reduced. If we revisit our original problem with this strategy, we can
demonstrate a high degree of partition tolerance. It can be said that the peers
in a network act as relays (hence the name of the protocol).</p>
<p>Bob continues to write (optionally encrypted) messages to Alice after she goes
offline, and his packets are published to the network. A network of only 1024
peers (split across multiple apps), will provide Bob’s packets a 100% survival
rate over a 24-hour period, without burdening any particular peer with storage
or compute requirements. Allowing Alice to return to the network and see Bob’s
most recent messages without the need for additional infrastructure.</p>
<h3 id="cache-negotiation">Cache Negotiation</h3>
<p>TODO</p>
<h3 id="connectionless">Connectionless</h3>
<p>TCP is often thought of as an ideal choice for packet delivery since it's
considered "reliable". With TCP packet loss, all packets are withheld until all
packets are received, this can be a delay of up to 1s (as per RFC6298 section
2.4). If the packet can't be retransmitted, an exponential backoff could lead to
another 600ms of delay needed for retransmission.</p>
<p>In fact, <code>Head-of-Line Blocking</code> is generally a problem with any ordered stream,
TCP (or UDP with additional higher-level protocol code for solving this problem).</p>
<p>TCP introduces other unwanted complexity that makes it less ideal for P2P.</p>
<p>UDP is only considered "unreliable" in the way that packets are not guaranteed
to be delivered. However, UDP is ideal for P2P networks because it’s message
oriented and connectionless (ideal for NAT traversal). Also because of its
message-oriented nature, it’s light-weight in terms of resource allocation. It's
the responsibility of a higher-level protocol to implement a strategy for
ensuring UDP packets are delivered.</p>
<p>Stream Relay Protocol eliminates Head-of-Line blocking entirely by reframing
packets as content-addressable Doubly-Linked lists, allowing packets to be
delivered out of order and become eventually consistent. Causal ordering is made
possible by traversing the previous ID or next ID to determine if there were
packets that came before or after one that is known.</p>
<p>And in the case where there is loss (or simply missing data), the receiver MAY
decide to request the packet. If the peer becomes unavailable, query the network
for the missing packet.</p>
<p>The trade-off is more data is required to re-frame the packet. The average
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_transmission_unit">MTU</a> for a UDP packet is ~1500 bytes. Stream Relay Protocol uses ~134 bytes
for framing, allocating <code>1024</code> bytes of application or protocol data, which is
<a href="https://gafferongames.com/post/snapshot_compression/">more than enough</a>.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-socket-runtime">What is Socket Runtime?</h3>
<p>Socket Runtime is a free and open source client-side Runtime that helps
web developers build apps for any OS, desktop, and mobile. You can use plain old
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as your favorite front-end libraries for
example React, Svelte, and Vue.</p>
<p>Socket ships binaries that start at ±1MB on desktop and ±12 Mb on mobile
because it leverages the OS's native webview. This is in contrast with Electron,
for example which ships an entire copy of a browser (and node) with each program.</p>

<p>Electron, Tauri, NativeScript, React Native, Ionic, etc?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Socket is for Web developers, there is no new language to learn.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Socket is the first and only cross-platform runtime built from the ground up
for desktop and mobile.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We embrace web standards instead of inventing new paradigms.</p>
</li>
<li><p>P2P and local-fisrt are first class features. We provide JavaScript APIs for
Bluetooth, UDP, and robust file system IO. These make it possible to create an
entirely new class of apps that are autonomous from the cloud and allow users
to communicate directly without any infrastructure requirements.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-should-i-care-about-p2p">Why should I care about P2P?</h3>
<p>P2P features allow a developer to create apps where users can communicate
directly, without the Cloud. It doesn’t require any servers at all, and even
works when users are offline. These features are optional, they are NOT turned
on by default and won't interupt or conflict with your existing architecture
or services.</p>
<h3 id="is-socket-a-service">Is Socket a Service?</h3>
<p>Socket is NOT a cloud service. We do not have a SaaS offering. And there is no
part of this that is hosted in the cloud.</p>
<p>There is a complementary application performance management product (APM),
Socket Operator, that can diagnose and remediate issues within the production
apps you build. This is also not a service, it's software.</p>
<h3 id="do-socket-apps-have-total-access-to-my-computer-like-electron-or-tauri">Do Socket apps have total access to my computer, like Electron or Tauri?</h3>
<p>Both Electron and Tauri's approach is to put all "business" logic into the
"main" process. The reason for this is 1. to avoid degrading the performance
of the UI (front-end) process, and 2. as a potential security measure.</p>
<p>However a "main" process is impossible to mitigate on desktop because there
is no sandboxing model like there is on mobile. Any touting of advanced security
procedures between the main and render process become theatre. It's really up
to the app creator to appeal to the user's sense of trust.</p>
<p>Socket Runtime takes a completely different approach. While we allow a "main"
process, it's completely optional, and not considered the best practice. If you
are shipping highly sensitive IP you may choose to put it here. If you have
compute intensive code, you can also put it here. But ideally you put it into
a worker thread.</p>
<p>Socket Apps can be written entirely in JavaScript, CSS and HTML. The UI process
and can be made secure via the CSP (a web standard for white-listing resource
access).</p>
<p>Invocation of filesystem, bluetooth, network, etc. is all made over IPC calls
that use a URI scheme (<code>ipc://...</code>), because of this, it works perfectly with
[CSP][CSP] (a well established web standard).</p>
<p>Any curious user can run a command like <code>strings foo.app | grep ipc://</code> on a
socket app bundle and examine the CSP of the index file.</p>
<h3 id="can-socket-apps-run-and-be-compiled-headlessly">Can Socket Apps run and be compiled headlessly?</h3>
<p>Yes. This makes it great for creating Web developer tooling since it has a
native DOM and all the browser APIs built in.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-i-trust-what-socket-is-doing-with-my-applications">How can I trust what Socket is doing with my applications?</h3>
<p>Socket is open-source. We would love for you to read all our code and see how
we're doing things! Feel free to contact us as well and we can walk you through
it.</p>
<h3 id="but-youre-also-a-business-so-you-have-to-have-some-private-technologies-that-you-charge-for-to-make-money">But you're also a business, so you have to have some private technologies that you charge for, to make money?</h3>
<p>As stated above, Socket Supply Co. builds and maintains a free and open source
Runtime that helps web developers build apps for any OS, desktop, and mobile, as
well as a p2p library, that enables developers to create apps where users can
communicate directly, without the Cloud. </p>
<p>These will always be open-source and free to use by any developer, no matter
what they use it for (commercial or personal). That will always be true.</p>
<p>Our Operator App has different tools which help in the entire lifecycle of
building, deploying, and monitoring the Socket apps you build. Operator App has
various pricing tiers which hackers, startups and enterprises can benefit from.</p>
<h3 id="we-already-have-teams-of-engineers-that-build-our-web-and-other-native-platform-app-experiences-why-would-we-benefit-from-socket">We already have teams of engineers that build our web and other native-platform app experiences. Why would we benefit from Socket?</h3>
<p>App builders can prioritize what they want to solve when working with Socket.
There are many benefits to choose from for a wide variety of reasons. </p>
<p>Cost reduction — For smaller teams who don’t have native teams in place,
they can get to their customers quicker by writing once, and running anywhere.
Cloud bills are the #1 cost for many organizations, building on Socket reduces
that to $0, or as much as you want to migrate off the cloud. We say crawl, walk,
run.</p>
<p>Autonomy — Right now you’re entirely codependent on a 3rd party to run a
mission-critical part of your business. The Cloud is a landlord-tenant
relationship with costs that can prevent your business from becoming profitable.
Socket helps you connect your users directly to each other, allowing you to rely
less on the Cloud,and reclaim your sovereignty, and your profit margins.</p>
<p>Complexity — Companies whose applications are built across desktop and
mobile would be moving from working and maintaining &gt;= 3 code bases in their
current state to 1 code base with Socket. This drastically reduces complexity
within the organization and speeds up feature releases. </p>
<p>Builders of network enabled Productivity and Collaboration tools will realize
major benefits by building on Socket. Evan Wallace, Co-founder from Figma said
it best "these days it’s obvious that multiplayer is the way all productivity
tools on the web should work, not just design."</p>
<h3 id="is-this-somehow-related-to-web3">Is this somehow related to Web3?</h3>
<p>If we define "web 3" to mean a decentralized web, then yes. We don’t really take
a position on anything else. We provide a technical foundation that makes it
possible for many Web3 ideals to come to fruition.</p>
<p>In its current state, Web3 is not decentralized. The ecosystem relies heavily on
centralized cloud providers like AWS for infrastructure. This is an economic
disadvantage and in most cases a barrier to entry. However, apps built with
Socket’s P2P capabilities can be 100% decentralized, absolutely no servers are
required. They can be fully autonomous, aligning directly with the mission of
the web3 community. </p>
<h3 id="does-p2p-without-servers-mean-that-it-only-works-if-peers-are-online">Does P2P (without servers) mean that it only works if peers are online?</h3>
<p>No! Socket's P2P protocol is designed for building disruption tolerant networks.
It achieves long-lived partition tolerance though bounded replication of
packets (limiting the number of hops and TTL of each packet that is relayed
between peers in the network). Socket's P2P protocol builds on a corpus of
existing academia. Please see the docs for more in depth details.</p>
<h3 id="if-i-send-information-to-my-friend-or-coworker-any-other-connected-peer-devices-will-see-this-message-as-they-relay-it-on">If I send information to my friend or coworker, any other connected peer devices will see this message as they relay it on?</h3>
<p>Peers <em>do</em> all relay packets for each other, to ensure that any peer <em>can</em>
communicate with any other peer, even if they aren't directly connected or ever
online with each other at the same time.</p>
<p>However, all data packets (those used for user data, not network coordination)
are encrypted, such that only the intended recipient of the packets can decrypt
and access the information therein.</p>
<p>So your message will reside in parts (packet by packet) on many other users'
devices, at various times, but only in parts and only encrypted, meaning those
other devices cannot make any sense of that data.</p>
<p>This encryption/decryption security uses industry-standard -- and audited! --
public key cryptography, similar to --- and at least as safe as! -- the
HTTPS/TLS encryption that users across the web trust for communication with very
sensitive sources, including banks, doctors, etc.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-i-know-that-a-message-i-receive-and-decrypt-was-not-tampered-with-or-faked-by-someone-other-than-who-the-message-claims-to-be-from">How do I know that a message I receive (and decrypt) was not tampered with or faked by someone other than who the message claims to be from?</h3>
<p>At the network packet level, packets are encrypted using the public key of the
intended recipient. Only the recipient (holding the paired private key) could
possibly decrypt the packet, which would be necessary for tampering.</p>
<p>Any man-in-the-middle tampering with an encrypted packet would render the final
decrypted value as garbage. The app would be able to immediately tell that the
expected data was garbled and thus discard it.</p>
<p>Corrupted (or manipulated) packets, or even dropped/missing packets, can be
automatically <em>re-queried</em> across the peer network, to reacquire the necessary
packets. As such, the encryption used guarantees that information received is
either complete and in-tact, before decryption, or entirely dropped.</p>
<p>As for determining the identity authenticity of the sender, the network protocol
does not employ overhead of digital signatures or verification, nor digital
certificates.</p>
<p>Socket apps are allowed, and expected, to employ their own security layered on
top of (tunneled through) the network encryption provided automatically. This
may include additional encryption, digital signatures, digital certificates
(identity verification), and more, according to the needs and capabilities of
the app.</p>
<p>All of those app-specific techniques are still leveraged and negotiated across
the Socket's peer network.</p>
<h3 id="i-am-nervous-about-other-people-transmitting-arbitrary-information-that-may-be-on-my-device-because-this-information-could-open-me-up-to-liability-legal-etc-how-am-i-protected-if-i-allow-my-device-to-relay-information-for-others-i-dont-know-or-trust">I am nervous about other people transmitting arbitrary information that may be on my device, because this information could open me up to liability (legal, etc). How am I protected if I allow my device to relay information for others I don't know or trust?</h3>
<p>Your device never holds plain-text (or plainly accessible) data on behalf of any
other user. The packets your device relays on behalf of others was encrypted for
those intended recipients, and your device could never possibly decrypt or make
sense of any of that data.</p>
<p>You thus have perfect deniability as your protection from those potential
risks and liabilities.</p>
<p>This is analogous to internet infrastructure like switches/routers, which are
peppered by the billions around the web. None of these devices can decrypt the
HTTPS traffic transiting through them, and thus none of those devices ever have
any liability for the kinds of information buried inside the encrypted data as
it flows through.</p>
<p>Socket isn't introducing anything more dangerous here than has already existed
for the last 25+ years of the internet.</p>
<p>More importantly, the relay of packets through your device only happens
<em>in memory</em> (never on disk), and only while you have a Socket powered app open
for use. If you close the app, or power-off / restart your device, that cache is
wiped completely; the in-memory cache only gets filled back up with more packets
when you open a Socket powered app while online.</p>
<p>As the device user, it's always your choice and in your control.</p>
<h3 id="does-this-mean-that-other-people-can-use-my-device-for-performing-heavy-computations-bitcoin-mining-etc-without-my-consent">Does this mean that other people can use my device for performing heavy computations (bitcoin mining, etc) without my consent?</h3>
<p>No!</p>
<p>The P2P relaying of packets is merely a pass-thru of (encrypted) data. Your
device performs almost no computation on these packets, other than to check the
plaintext headers to figure out whether and how to relay it along.</p>
<p>Aside from this very simple and fast processing of these packets, your device
will never perform any computation on behalf of any other person.</p>
<p>The <em>only</em> exception would be computation you had directly and expressly
consented to via an app that you chose to install and open/use, <em>if</em> that app
was designed in such a way to share computation work with others.</p>
<p>For example, "SETI@home" type apps intentionally distribute computation (image
processing, etc) among a vast array of devices that have idle/unused computing
power being <em>donated</em> to a good cause. Another plausible example: some apps are
currently exploring distributing machine-learning (ML/AI) computations among an
array of peers.</p>
<p>If you installed such an app, and opened it, your device would subject itself to
app-level computation on behalf of others. But you remain in control of all
those decisions, including closing such apps, uninstalling them, etc. And if you
didn't install and open such an app, none of that distributed computation would
ever happen on your device, regardless of how others use the P2P network.</p>
<p><strong>No unintended/background/abusive computation on your device is ever be possible</strong>
by virtue of the Socket P2P protocol itself. Only apps themselves can coordinate
such distributed computation activities, and only with expressed installation
consent from users.</p>
<h3 id="aside-from-cpu-computation-doesnt-allow-my-device-to-participate-in-packet-relay-for-many-other-peers-subject-my-device-to-extra-resource-utilization-using-up-my-memory-draining-my-battery-more-quickly-etc">Aside from CPU computation, doesn't allow my device to participate in packet relay for many other peers subject my device to extra resource utilization (using up my memory, draining my battery more quickly, etc)?</h3>
<p>The only resource utilization that occurs is that which you consent to by
opening and using Socket apps.</p>
<p>Socket limits the memory used for the packet relay cache, currently to 16MB
(not GB!). This is an extremely small slice of typical device memory, even
budget-level smartphones (which typically have at least 1-2 GB of memory).</p>
<p>As for the battery, Socket does not perform unnecessary background work, so any
battery usage you experience should be directly proportional to the active use
of a Socket powered app.</p>
<p>Relaying packets is a very simple and resource-light type of task. In our
testing, we haven't seen any noticeable increase in resource load on devices as
a result of running a Socket powered app, compared to any other consumer apps
users typically use.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, Socket powered apps tend to use and transmit way less data
than other commercial/consumer apps, so users can expect in general to see no
worse -- and often much improved! -- resource utilization than for non-Socket
apps.</p>
<h3 id="does-p2p-packet-relay-mean-that-data-transmission-such-as-me-sending-a-text-message-or-picture-to-a-friend-will-go-much-slower">Does P2P packet relay mean that data transmission, such as me sending a text message or picture to a friend, will go much slower?</h3>
<p>P2P packet relay, even across a broad network of many millions of devices, is
surprisingly fast and efficient, compared to typical presumptions.</p>
<p>If the sender and receiver of a message are both online at the time of a message
being sent and are at most a few hops away in terms of the packet relay protocol
of Socket, this transmission should take no more than a few hundred miliseconds
at most.</p>
<p>In fact, since this communication is much more direct than in typical
infrastructure, where messages have to go all the way out to a cloud server, and
then on to the recipient, it's quite likely that communications will be at least
as fast, if not much faster, via P2P communications techniques (relay, etc) as
described.</p>
<h3 id="if-the-recipient-of-my-message-is-not-online-when-i-send-it-how-long-will-the-packets-stay-alive-in-the-p2p-network-before-being-dropped-if-the-recipient-has-not-yet-come-online-and-received-the-packets">If the recipient of my message is not online when I send it, how long will the packets <em>stay alive</em> in the P2P network before being dropped, if the recipient has not yet come online and received the packets?</h3>
<p>There's a lot of <em>it depends</em> on this answer (including the size of the message,
how many packets, and network activity/congestion). But in general, messages may
be able to survive for as long as a couple of weeks and almost never less than
several days.</p>
<p>Apps are expected to design with the nature of the lack of delivery guarantees
in P2P networks in focus. To help users compensate and adapt, these apps should
provide appropriate user experience affordances, including "resend",
"read receipt", and other such capabilities.</p>
<h3 id="ive-heard-that-p2p-is-too-hard-and-doesnt-work-because-nat-traversal-is-hard">I've heard that P2P is too hard and doesn't work because NAT traversal is hard.</h3>
<p>This is a hard problem. And until now there hasn't been a comprehensive solution
for Web Developers.</p>
<p>We are able to reliably connect all kinds of NAT's. For hard-to-hard NATs, we
rely on other features of our protocol.</p>
<p>NAT traversal and negotiation are automatically handled, so that app developers
do not need to worry about these messy details. That said, all our code is open-
source, so we invite you to take a deeper look if you're curious about how we
handle these complicated tasks on your app's behalf. Our work builds on a corpus
of peer reviewed academia, primarily <a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/p2pnat.pdf">this</a> paper.</p>
<h3 id="bad-actors-are-certainly-going-to-try-to-flood-the-network-with-junk-to-denydegrade-service-dos-attacks-attack-peers-ddos-attacks-etc-how-can-this-p2p-network-possibly-survive-such-abuse">Bad actors are certainly going to try to flood the network with junk, to deny/degrade service (DoS attacks), attack peers (DDoS attacks), etc. How can this P2P network possibly survive such abuse?</h3>
<p>The P2P packet relay protocol includes a sophisticated set of <em>balancing</em>
techniques, which acts to ensure that no peer on the network places an outsized
burden on other peers in the network.</p>
<p>Fluctuations and usage differences of course are a reality, but the protocol
naturally resists the kinds of behaviors that bad actors rely on.</p>
<p>We've done a significant amount of modeling simulations and real-world field
tests, and we're convinced that these types of attacks will ultimately prove
impractical and not affect the ultimate trajectory and growth of our P2P network.</p>
<h3 id="is-this-like-bittorrent-tor-napster-gnutella-etc">Is this like BitTorrent, Tor, Napster, Gnutella etc?</h3>
<p>The web's roots are P2P, and yes there have been a number of widely known
(and sometimes infamous!) attempts to bring the web back to its P2P identity
over the years; some good, some not so good. Most of these are focused on file
sharing. We see a broader opportunity with P2P which is focused on connectivity,
reduced infrastructure cost, and reduced complexity in general.</p>
<p>We think the time has come for the web to return to the P2P model by default, to
dismantle the wasteful and unnecessarily complicated (and expensive!)
centralization trend that has given rise to the age of the "cloud". There ar
more than enough consumer devices, many of them highly connected, to accomplish
a de-centralization.</p>
<p>While these changes have profound effects on improving how developers and
businesses build and deliver experiences to consumers, it's the revolution of a
user-centric web that most excites us.</p>
<p>Users don't need all of their data sent up to the cloud, nor do they want that.
Users want privacy by default. Users don't need or want to be tracked with every
single click or keystroke. Users don't want to <em>wait</em>, staring at spinners,
while entire applications full of tens of megabytes of images, fonts, and JS
code re-download every single page load. Users don't want or need walled-garden
app stores to single-handedly decide what apps they're allowed to access, or how
they're allowed to communicate and collaborate using those apps. Users don't
want experiences that only work if they have a perfect internet connection, and
die or are unavailable when wifi gets spotty.</p>
<p>All of these are hallmarks of the web as it is today, and all of these are
tricks designed to work in favor of big centralized companies that slurp up all
our data and then charge us rent to hold it. All of these are user-hostile
behaviors that for the most part users can't opt out of, but overwhelmingly
don't actually want.</p>
<p>Socket is a foundational building block that we believe can help usher in a
new age of the web, one that puts users first. One that blurs the lines between
websites and apps, and puts all those amazing experiences right on user's
devices for them to use instantly, no matter where they are or what kind of
internet connection they have (or not!). One that defaults to a local-first
(or even local-only!) model that <em><strong>protects users' information by default</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Putting developers in control, and moreover putting users in control, isn't a
fad or a phase. We think it's exactly where the web has to go to survive, and we
believe it's where everyone that builds for the web will shift to eventually.
Those are admittedly pretty big aspirations and goals, but they're far from
unrealistic or naive.</p>
