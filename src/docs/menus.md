# Menus
Menus are created at run time from either the main or render process.

## System Menus

The semi colon is significant indicates the end of the menu. Use an
underscore when there is no accelerator key. Modifiers are optional.
For the edit menu, `op` will figure out which accelerators to use
for you.

```js
system.setMenu(`
  App:
    Foo: f;

  Edit:
    Cut: x
    Copy: c
    Paste: v
    Delete: _
    Select All: a;

  Other:
    Apple: _
    Another Test: T
    Some Thing: S + Meta
    ---: _
    Bazz: s + Meta, Control, Alt;
`)

```

#### Submenus

It's our opinion that submenus are an anti-pattern. Complexity deserves a
wider visual surface area.

#### Separators

To create a separator, use `---`. Separators don't have modifiers so just
use `_` to indicate that.

#### Accelerator Modifiers

Accelerator modifiers are used as visual indicators but don't have a
material impact as the actual key binding is done in the event listener.

A capital letter implies that the accelerator is modified by the `Shift` key.

Additional accelerators are `Meta`, `Control`, `Option`, each separated
by commas. If one is not applicable for a platform, it will just be ignored.

On MacOS `Meta` is the same as `Command`.

#### Menu Events

When a menu item is activated, it raises the `menuItemSelected` event in
the front end code, you can then communicate with your backend code if you
want from there.

For example, if the `Apple` item is selected from the `Other` menu...

```js
window.addEventListener('menuItemSelected', event => {
  assert(event.detail.parent === 'Other')
  assert(event.detail.title === 'Apple')
})
```

## Context Menus

Dynamically build a context menu and await the user's selection.

```js
const value = await window.contextMenu({
  Download: 'D',
  Wizard: 'W',
  Share: 'S'
})
```

If the user presses `w` or clicks the `Wizard` menu item, the following
statement will evalute true.

```js
assert(value === { title: 'Wizard', parent: 'contextMenu', state: 0 })
```
